description: Result- The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for the camera were calculated. The iteration technique was used where a checkerboard was mounted on robotic armâ€™s end-effector and moved through to obtain different posses. The difference between the position of detected checkerboard and checkerboard projected into the camera image is minimized to find the transformation.
