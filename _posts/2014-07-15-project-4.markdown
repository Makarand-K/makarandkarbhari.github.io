description: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Challenge</strong>- To get the transformation of the camera with respect to end-effector of the robotic manipulator.<p>
description2: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Solution</strong>- Various transformation techniques were investigated. <font color="ffaa71">Optimal technique</font> was selected based on the design constraints for the camera.</p>
description3: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Result</strong>- The <font color="ffaa71">intrinsic and extrinsic parameters</font> for the camera were calculated. The iteration technique was used where a checkerboard was mounted on robotic arm’s end-effector and moved through to obtain different posses. The difference between the position of detected checkerboard and checkerboard projected into the camera image is minimized to find the transformation. <font color="ffaa71">Min ||𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑚(𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑) − 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑚(𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑)|| ≤ 𝑆𝑒𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒</font>.</p>
