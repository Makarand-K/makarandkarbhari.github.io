description: <strong>Challenge</strong>- To get the position and orientation of the object in a 2D using a camera.
description2: <strong>Solution</strong>- In this experiment I achieved this by using a webcam and LabVIEW software. The object can be located with the help of three co-ordinates i.e. by measuring distance in X, Y and Z direction. In our case I assumed the camera to be at the fixed distance from the object plane which means my distance in Z direction of rotation i.e. along Z direction.
description3: <strong>Result</strong>- 4 different objects with their position and orientation are determined using this algorithm.
