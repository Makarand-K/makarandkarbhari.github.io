description: <p style="font-size:18px;">In this assignment, I was using a pretrained network and apply it to new dataset. A pretrained Neural network called VGG16 was used for this purpose. <font color="ffaa71">4 different class</font> of test images were provided and the neural network that I created was able to detect these classes successfully with testing accuracy of <font color="ffaa71">73.75%</font>.</p>
