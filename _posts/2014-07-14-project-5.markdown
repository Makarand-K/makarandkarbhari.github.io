description: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Challenge</strong>- To <font color="ffaa71">design and manufacture a prototype</font> of cost-effective and easy interactive machine which can climb the areca nut tree and to cut the fruits attached to the tree. </p>
description2: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Solution</strong>- A <font color="ffaa71">mechanism</font> which considered the <font color="ffaa71">varying diameter of the trunk</font> of the areca nut tree was developed. Also, keeping in mind the robustness of the machine static analysis results were obtained with the help of simulation software.</p>
description3: <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Result</strong>- The machine was able to successfully climb the tree with <font color="ffaa71">33% reduced time</font> that would take an average skilled person to climb tree. Also, the machine cost was less by <font color="ffaa71">20% compared to wages</font> of the person who climbed the trees per acre.</p>
