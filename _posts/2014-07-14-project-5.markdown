description: Solution- A mechanism which considered the varying diameter of the trunk of the areca nut tree was developed. Also, keeping in mind the robustness of the machine static analysis results were obtained with the help of simulation software.I believe being genuine and nurturing, along with professional and driven, is an essential combination for people in my field. I am proficient in 3D design and modelling, an understanding of materials and have practiced different manufacturing technologies. I am also cognizant about system engineering and process development from my projects and work experience. Additionally, my abilities extend to decision-making and organization with proficiency in communication.
