client: 3DEXPERIENCE, SIMULIA, Arduino 
category: Prototype Design and Manufacturing, FEA Analysis, DFA, DFM
solution:Solution- A mechanism which considered the varying diameter of the trunk of the areca nut tree was developed. Also, keeping in mind the robustness of the machine static analysis results were obtained with the help of simulation software.
approach:Challenge- To design and manufacture a prototype of cost-effective and easy interactive machine which can climb the areca nut tree and to cut the fruits attached to the tree. 
result:Result- The machine was able to successfully climb the tree with 33% reduced time that would take an average skilled person to climb tree.
