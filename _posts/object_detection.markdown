description: Object identification can be done with various approaches like with the help of barcodes, RFID or vision systems. Based on the constraints and dependencies in our application I identified the object with the help of a camera using the combination of YOLO V3 algorithm for object detection and a color-detection algorithm to classify the object in order to get the classified object’s properties from the metadata.
